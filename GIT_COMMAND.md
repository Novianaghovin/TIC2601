Key Differences:
- Staging (git add): Prepares changes for commit, allowing you to select which changes will be included in the next commit. n/
- Committing (git commit): Saves the staged changes to your local repository's history. The changes are still local to your machine.
- Pushing (git push): Transfers your local commits to the remote repository so that others can access your changes or so they are stored in a centralized location like GitHub.

Workflow with Push:
- Make Changes: Edit files in your working directory.
- Stage Changes: Use git add to add specific changes to the staging area.
- Commit Changes: Use git commit to save the changes in your local repository.
- Push Changes: Use git push to send your commits to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
