UPDATED AS OF 26 OCTOBER 2024:
1) Have built the challenge web UI using react.js to display the top navigation bar, 
My Challenges with the leaderboard button and Available Challenges with the Join button.

2) Available Challenges table can be populated now via API to the backend server where it sends SQL query to our DB to fetch the data
   However, the Join button feature is not available yet.

3) My Challenges will not be populated yet as it requires integration with the other tables.

4) The top navigation bar have all the buttons required but the feature is not available yet as well.
